The image portrays two cats lying on a couch. Both of them have grey and brown markings, resembling the color of high-rise buildings. They are side by side, laying down in a relaxed manner, in a cozy setting. The cats seem to be sleeping, sharing the same comfortable spot on the couch. One cat appears to be larger, while the other is smaller in comparison. A remote control is lying on the couch between the cats, possibly used for controlling a television or other electronic devices.
